Content-based image retrieval "CBIR" allows us to search in a database of images by entering an image and not words, the system will search for images similar to the image that was attached to the search 

The system needs a feature to match, so we used pca, it's a classic but powerful machine learning tool, implemented on the cbir 10 database, here is an example of the results.
